        <p>At MPH-Studios, we value your privacy and are committed to ensuring that your personal information is protected. This Privacy Policy outlines the data we collect, how we use it, and the steps we take to protect your privacy while using our games.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Usernames and Passwords:</strong> We allow players to create an account with any username and password of their choice. These usernames and passwords do not need to be real, and we do not require any personal identification. If an email is used as a username, it is only used to track your progress and purchases within our games.</li>
            <li><strong>No Personal Data Collection:</strong> We do not collect any other personal information, such as your real name, address, or payment information. We do not store any data other than what is necessary to track game progress and in-game purchases.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Ads in Our Games</h2>
        <p>MPH-Studios displays ads in our games to support the development of our products.

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable precautions to protect your data. However, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
